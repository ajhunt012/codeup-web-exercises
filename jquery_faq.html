    <dt>What is the origin of the National Park Service arrowhead?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">The arrowhead was authorized as the official National Park Service emblem by the Secretary of
        the Interior on July 20, 1951. The components of the arrowhead may have been inspired by key attributes of the
        National Park System, with the sequoia tree and bison representing vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and
        water representing scenic and recreational values, and the arrowhead itself representing historical and
        archaeological values.
    </dd>


    <dt>How many areas are in the National Park System?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">The system includes 423 areas covering more than 85 million acres in every state, the District
        of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These areas include national parks,
        monuments, battlefields, military parks, historical parks, historic sites, lakeshores, seashores, recreation
        areas, scenic rivers and trails, and the White House.
    </dd>

    <dt>How do I obtain a park entrance pass?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Fewer than one-third of the national parks charge entrance fees. You can obtain park entrance
        passes by visiting a park site that charges an entrance fee. Entrance fee sites have passes available; we
        recommend calling a park prior to your visit. (See the park search to locate a specific park.) There are a
        number of entrance passes available, including park-specific passes as well as passes that offer entrance to
        more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to the national parks (Annual, Military, Senior, 4th Grade,
        Access, and Volunteer passes)

<h3>Zion National Park</h3>
<ul class="park">
    <li>The park was first protected in 1909 when President William Howard Taft designated Mukuntuweap National Monument using the power of the 1906 Antiquities Act. In the 10 years until it became a national park, it was expanded, and its name was changed to Zion. </li>
    <li>Zion has one of the largest freestanding arches in the world.</li>
    <li>In 1909, Zion was virtually inaccessible to visitors because of poor road conditions and limited railway. Once Zion became a national park, people wanted to explore it. To make this possible, construction began on a 25-mile stretch of road to connect Zion to the Grand Canyon and Bryce Canyon. Completed in 1930, the Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway and Tunnel is a must see.</li>
    <li>Zion National Park also happens to be home to the California Condor, which has been on the list of endangered species since 1967. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Grand Teton National Park</h3>
<ul class="park">
    <li>The Grand Tetons were the cause of a seismic disaster</li>
    <li>Grand Teton is the Only U.S. National Park with a Commercial Airport</li>
    <li>In total, Grand Teton National Park is home to 11 active glaciers. While all are still considered “active,” many of these glaciers have lost a lot of their ice volume, so that they are no longer flowing. Of the 11 glaciers, 10 of these are named, while the 11th remains unnamed.</li>
    <li>When Jackson Hole National Monument was founded in 1943, cattle ranchers mounted a protest. They led over 500 cattle into the valley of Jackson Hole. Their charge was led by Wallace Beery, a famous Hollywood actor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Yellowstone National Park</h3>
<ul class="park">
    <li> Half the world’s hydrothermal features are found at Yellowstone.</li>
    <li> Beyond its geysers, Yellowstone is world-renowned for its bison herds. It’s the only place in the U.S. where bison have lived continuously since prehistoric times</li>
    <li>Yellowstone is home to the largest concentration of mammals in the lower 48. Yellowstone’s wildlife is abundant and diverse with an estimated 300 species of birds, 16 types of fish and 67 species of mammals — the largest number of mammal species in the contiguous United States</li>
    <li>One of the world’s largest active volcanoes lies beneath Yellowstone. The first major eruption of the Yellowstone volcano occurred 2.1 million years ago and covered more than 5,790 square miles with ash. That's among the largest volcanic eruptions known, and marks Yellowstone as a supervolcano (a term used to describe any volcano with an eruption of more than 240 cubic miles of magma). While the volcano is still active, it’s been about 70,000 years since the last lava flow. With the U.S. Geological Survey and University of Utah, the National Park Service established the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory in 2001 to monitor volcanic and seismic activity in the area.</li>
